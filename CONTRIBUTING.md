# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in this project.

This repository is **publicly available for use**, but it is **not currently accepting pull requests that modify the codebase**. The best way to engage is through **GitHub Discussions**, where we can troubleshoot, compare approaches, and share patterns safely.

## Where to ask what

### ✅ Use Discussions for:
- “How do I…?” questions
- Troubleshooting installs / R / Quarto / Power BI
- Modeling questions (grain, keys, relationships)
- DAX/measures help
- “How did you handle X at your institution?” (no sensitive details)
- Feature ideas / requests

### ✅ Use Issues for:
- Confirmed bugs with clear steps to reproduce
- Documentation fixes (typos, broken links, unclear instructions)

### ❌ Do not use Issues or PRs for:
- Sharing real conduct exports, identifiers, or narratives
- Posting screenshots that include student/staff info
- Uploading “sample data” that came from a real system

## Pull requests

At this time, PRs that change code will generally be closed with a request to start a Discussion instead.

If you believe you have a **critical bug fix**, please:
1. Open an Issue with a minimal reproducible example (synthetic data only).
2. Describe the expected vs actual behavior.
3. Include environment details (R version, OS, Quarto version).

If a fix is confirmed, I may implement it directly or invite a targeted PR.

## Safe sharing / privacy

This project relates to student conduct data. Please assume the highest privacy bar:
- Do not share real exports or personally identifying information (PII).
- Do not share case narratives or incident descriptions.
- Use synthetic data for examples and reproduction.
- When sharing screenshots, blur/redact anything sensitive.

If you accidentally posted sensitive information, delete it immediately and report it (see SECURITY.md).

## Suggestions that help the most

If you want to improve the project without changing code, these are very welcome:
- clearer docs and diagrams
- examples using synthetic data
- troubleshooting notes for common setup issues
- Power BI modeling guidance and measure patterns (no real data)

Thanks again for keeping discussion helpful and safe.
